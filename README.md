# Report

The report is contained in `./groebner-bases.ipynb`, it was originally a latex document which is contained in `archive/groebner-bases-report.tex`.

Referencing has been handled by using BibTeX citeID's as I wanted to avoid using citeproc to format the references in order to try and keep the work more reproducible.
