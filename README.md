# Report

The deliverables are composed of two parts, theory and practical:

1. `./groebner-bases-report.pdf` Detailing Investigation so far
  * I was originally going to `pandoc` this into a *Jupyter Notebook*, however, given how much underlying theory this topic had, it felt a bit silly.
  * I'm happy to export to a *Jupyter Notebook* if necessary
2. `./sympy_groebner_bases.ipynb` attempting to implement Buchberger's Algorithm
  * This still needs more work, I think I've got the general idea of how it should work, I just need some time to implement it.
